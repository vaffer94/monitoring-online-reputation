The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay.
